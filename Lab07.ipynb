    "In the charming little town named \"Culinary Haven\", there stood a restaurant called \"The Enchanted Fork\". This restaurant was more than just a place to eat; it was a magical experience that left a lasting impression on all who visited. The restaurant is also famous for its management application that takes up customer orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software collects the order details for the customers. The application generates a unique orderid for each order based on the below specifications. The software system has a predefined menu of Itemss and their prices, from which the user can select them.\n",
    "\n",
    "OrderID is created with the help of a combination of 5 randomom numbers generated with the help of a randomom library in Python. You can use randomom.randomint() function to get one randomom integer at a time and the order id is generated by concatenating five such numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from orderid, each order will have the Itemss ordered and their quantity saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application has the following options in its menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create new order\n",
    "View Orders (List and calculate the bill for each order)\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "Each order will have a unique orderID generated as per the specifications given.\n",
    "Each order can have multiple Itemss.\n",
    "Once the order is completed, you may calculate the total order value\n",
    "You can set a predefined menu and price for the Itemss\n",
    "Expectations:\n",
    "Identify the appropriate data storage mechanisms to store the order data effectively.\n",
    "Usage of functions\n",
    "menu Itemss stored in the format: [[\"Rice\",30],[\"Tea\",10],.....]\n",
